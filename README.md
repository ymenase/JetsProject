# JetsProject

This is my first OO program for Skill Distillery 8. The user visits the jet rental store 
and can sort the jets by speed and range. User can also create a custom jet. Each jet has
a pilot, and the user can select one of the pilots as well. In the future, I would like to
add logic to add additional pilots, delete pilots, and improve the assignment process.
